# Embbeded Systems with Arduino

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Arduino-based projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate different functionalities and applications of Arduino. Currently, the repository includes the following projects:

1. [Parking Ticket System](parking_ticket_system/README.md)
2. [Throttle Body Control with Potentiometer](throttle_body_w_pot/README.md)

More projects will be added in the future.

## Projects

### 1. Parking Ticket System

The Parking Ticket System is an Arduino-based project designed to simulate a parking ticket dispenser and gate control system. This project uses push buttons to simulate the sensors and a servo to simulate the gate opening and closing. Furthermore, the LCD displays the status of the system.

- [Project Details](parking_ticket_system/README.md)
- [Source Code](parking_ticket_system/parking_ticket_system.cpp)

### 2. Throttle Body Control with Potentiometer

This project uses an Arduino to control an automotive throttle body. The system allows adjusting the throttle body opening using a potentiometer, simulating the operation of an electronic throttle.

- [Project Details](throttle_body_w_pot/README.md)
- [Source Code](throttle_body_w_pot/throttle_body_w_pot.cpp)

## Installation
