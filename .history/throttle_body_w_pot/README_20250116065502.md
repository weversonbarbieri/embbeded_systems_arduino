## Arduino Throttle Body Control

## Description

This project uses an Arduino to control an automotive throttle body. The system allows adjusting the throttle body opening using a potentiometer, simulating the operation of an electronic throttle.

## Components Used

  * 1 un 9 volts battery
  * 1 un Power supply
  * 1 un Arduino
  * 1 un Potentiometer
  * 1 un Multimeter
  * 1 un Protoboard
  * 1 un Transistor
  * 1 un Resistor
  * 1 un Diode
  * 1 un Throttle body

## Circuit Diagram

## How It Works

The system works by reading the value from the potentiometer and mapping it to a range of 0 to 255. This value is then written to the Arduino's PWM output, which controls the throttle body opening. If the potentiometer value is 0, the throttle body is closed.

## Installation

  - Connect all components according to the circuit diagram.
  - Upload the provided code to the Arduino.
  - Power the system using the power supply and the 9 volts battery.
  - Use the potentiometer to adjust the throttle body opening.
